# CSS Playground

CSS Playground is a place to learn and absord the advanced concepts of CSS3 like transforms, transitions and animations.


## Description
This interactive app is made using HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript. It is interactive in nature. I have used svgs to mimic meteor shower in home screen's background.
Dark and Light mode is implemented using CSS variables.



##To run it locally:
1. First clone the repo
2. Run the index.html file

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits and use a live server to deploy it.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
